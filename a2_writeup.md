# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?

The hardest part was dealing with the %, it can mean any num. Meaning i had to be careful when parsing through the text in order to not skip too much or run out of things to check. It got a little harder when mixing % and _ since i had to make sure that the matches were right.

2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.

The match function works like a pattern matcher. You can use _ to grab one word, or % for several. These different pieces can be then used to search through the database or build a structred query.
